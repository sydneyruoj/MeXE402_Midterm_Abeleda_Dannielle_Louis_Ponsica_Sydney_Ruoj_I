# ðŸ”°Introduction

**Linear regression** is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous dependent variable based on one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the dependent variable (output) and the independent variables (input). Mathematically, it fits a line, known as the "best fit line," through the data points, minimizing the difference between predicted and actual values.

**Logistic Regression** is a statistical method used for binary classification problems that is used for prediction tasks. The outcome variable is catrgorical and typically takes on two possible values. In the dataset given, the outcome is either Diabetic or Not Diabetic which are translated into numerical form of _Diabetic = 1_ and _Not Diabetic = 0_. 

# ðŸ“’Dataset Description

### [Linear Regression Dataset](https://github.com/sydneyruoj/MeXE402_Midterm_Abeleda_Dannielle_Louis_Ponsica_Sydney_Ruoj_I/tree/main/Linear%20Regression)
The **Boston House Prices** dataset contains information about various factors influencing housing prices in Boston suburbs, collected by the U.S. Census Service. It includes 506 observations with 13 features, such as the average number of rooms, crime rate, accessibility to highways, and more, all used to predict the median value of homes. This dataset is commonly used in linear regression analysis to understand how these factors impact housing prices.

### Logistic Regression Dataset
The Pima Indians Diabetes Database contains data collected from 768 women of Pima Indian heritage, focusing on attributes related to diabetes risk. The dataset includes 8 features:

- Number of pregnancies
- Plasma glucose concentration
- Diastolic blood pressure
- Triceps skinfold thickness
- 2-hour serum insulin
- Body mass index (BMI)
- Diabetes pedigree function (genetic risk)
- Age

The target variable indicates whether the individual was diagnosed with diabetes (1) or not (0).

# ðŸ”§Project Objectives

### Regression Analysis Objectives

**Goal:** Develop regression models to predict outcomes, whether continuous or categorical, through Linear and Logistic Regression.

1. **Data Preparation:** Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and necessary encoding or normalization to ensure data quality and model readiness.
  
2. **Model Implementation:** Utilize libraries (e.g., Scikit-learn) to build and configure models, adapting parameters to optimize performance for both continuous and categorical predictions.

3. **Evaluation and Metrics:** Use metrics such as R-squared, Mean Squared Error, and accuracy, alongside tools like confusion matrices, to assess model accuracy and reliability.

4. **Interpretation:** Analyze model coefficients to understand feature importance, predict outcomes, and draw insights from the modelâ€™s predictive strength and classification ability. 

Together, these objectives aim to create robust and interpretable models that address practical prediction and classification tasks.

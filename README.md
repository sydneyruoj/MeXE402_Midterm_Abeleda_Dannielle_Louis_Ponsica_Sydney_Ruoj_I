# ðŸ”°Introduction

**Linear regression** is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous dependent variable based on one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the dependent variable (output) and the independent variables (input). Mathematically, it fits a line, known as the "best fit line," through the data points, minimizing the difference between predicted and actual values.

**Logistic Regression** is a statistical method used for binary classification problems that is used for prediction tasks. The outcome variable is catrgorical and typically takes on two possible values. In the dataset given, the outcome is either Diabetic or Not Diabetic which are translated into numerical form of _Diabetic = 1_ and _Not Diabetic = 0_. 

# ðŸ“’Dataset Description

### Linear Regression Dataset
The **Boston House Prices** dataset contains information about various factors influencing housing prices in Boston suburbs, collected by the U.S. Census Service. It includes 506 observations with 13 features, such as the average number of rooms, crime rate, accessibility to highways, and more, all used to predict the median value of homes. This dataset is commonly used in linear regression analysis to understand how these factors impact housing prices.

### Logistic Regression Dataset
The Pima Indians Diabetes Database contains data collected from 768 women of Pima Indian heritage, focusing on attributes related to diabetes risk. The dataset includes 8 features:

- Number of pregnancies
- Plasma glucose concentration
- Diastolic blood pressure
- Triceps skinfold thickness
- 2-hour serum insulin
- Body mass index (BMI)
- Diabetes pedigree function (genetic risk)
- Age

The target variable indicates whether the individual was diagnosed with diabetes (1) or not (0).

# ðŸ”§Project Objectives

1. **Predictive Modeling**: Utilize linear regression to predict house prices and logistic regression for diabetes diagnosis, demonstrating the application of statistical methods.
2. **Data Analysis**: Investigate relationships between key variables in both datasets to understand factors influencing health and economic outcomes.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the effectiveness of various regression techniques in different contexts, fostering skills in model selection and validation.
4. **Interdisciplinary Insights**: Explore how data-driven approaches can inform decision-making across healthcare and real estate sectors.

This framework provides a broad perspective applicable to various fields.

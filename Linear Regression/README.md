Evaluation Metrics
  *R-Squared = 0.8774370925197137
  *Adjusted R-Squared = 0.8197604301760495
  *Mean Squared Error = 7.652119236368388
Interpretation
  *The intercept represents the expected value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are equal to zero. In this context, it indicates that if all predictor variables were zero, the response variable would be approximately 93.45.
  *A negative coefficient indicates that as the corresponding predictor variable increases by one unit, the response variable is expected to decrease, assuming all other variables remain constant.
  *A positive coefficient indicates that as the corresponding predictor variable increases, the response variable is expected to increase.
  *The intercept and coefficients give us valuable insights into how each predictor affects the response variable. To really evaluate the model's accuracy and the importance of each predictor, it's crucial to look at their statistical significance along with the coefficients.
